## Sprint 3 - Plan

 * Start date: 8th July 2023
 * End date: 21st July 2023

## Process

In short, we plan our sprint on the Saturday after it starts, breaking down tasks to be completed during that meeting. We self-assign those tasks and work on them during the sprint, and we merge the results to dev when complete.

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

* This sprint, we plan to start earlier, and will be beginning our group standups earlier in the week to encourage this and to improve team coordination prior to the last week. Exact start date will be decided during our Tuesday meeting. This should allow for a more consistent rate of change of the project across the sprint.
* Future documentation and sprint deliverables will be committed to our dev branch instead of our main branch and will be copied to main with our code from dev. This should prevent another situation like last sprint where our sprint deliverables that were committed directly to main were deleted when we merged our code from dev into main.


#### Roles & responsibilities

We are still not explicitly assigning roles to team members. Each team member can assign themselves to tasks they want to take on on Jira, and the team collectively is responsible that they all get done.

That said, we are continuing with the same team members as the previous sprint being primarily responsible for each deliverable document:
* Iteration plan & Sprint review - Alex
* Burndown chart - Sanjay
* Schedule - Pan
* System design document - Jawad
* Updating product backlog - Giselle
* Updating other documentation - Katy

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

We met Saturday July 8th and plan to meet after class on Tuesday July 11th. We will decide on Tuesday whether we would benefit from another meeting on Saturday July 15th.

The July 8th meeting was our sprint retrospective for sprint 2 and planning meeting for this sprint. We agreed on the user stories to tackle this sprint and broke them down into smaller tasks. Our Tuesday meetings are in-person check-ins for any issues team members want to bring up, and Tuesday July 11th in particular will be used to decide when we will begin standups for this week. We are waiting until then to decide so that we can ask the professor about how we can structure standups first. The founder is invited to the Saturday meetings, but did not join the July 8th meeting.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

Similarly to the last sprint, we have a Jira board with the tasks (broken down from larger user stories) we aim to complete this sprint, which is our primary means of organizing the tasks we have to complete and who will handle each one. We also plan to communicate via our daily standups to keep informed of project progress and identify any impediments the team is facing.

In our first meeting, we chose a team member to be primarily responsible for each deliverable, as described in the roles section, and we are continuing with these assignments. This is our main strategy of making sure all of the deliverables are completed. Assignments were originally made based on team members volunteering for each task.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

We have a main branch and a dev branch, plus individual branches managed by whoever creates them. All new development is made off of the dev branch, and all tasks are considered completed only when their functionality is merged into the dev branch. Pull requests to the dev branch must be approved by at least one other team member (not the creator of the pr) before being merged. We don’t have any specific requirements on what team member approves the pull request, and as long as it’s approved, anyone can merge it. At the end of the sprint, dev gets merged into main, and everyone has the chance to test the functionality of dev when this happens.

Branches should include the ticket number of the Jira ticket(s) that the branch addresses, and optionally the name(s) of the team members who worked on the code in it. These are both to make it more clear at a glance what the branch is for and who can be contacted about it if necessary. Having the Jira ticket number at the start of the branch name now also connects that Jira ticket and that branch through automatic integration of Github and Jira (which is finally set up).

* Editing Information Saved as Arrays on the Startup and Student Profile Pages - Alex

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

The artifacts we will produce this sprint are the same as we did for the last sprint:

* the code itself, which will be uploaded to GitHub, and is important because it is the actual project
    * this is effectively an interactive mockup in addition to being the end goal, since it can be run locally to demonstrate the functionality of the project when done
* a wireframe of the intended layout of the project, created in figma, to guide our development efforts

* while it is not something we ourselves created, the founder has provided some example features created on Bumble that he would like us to use to help guide our development efforts as well
