# Git Hype

## Sprint 1- Review & Retrospect

 * When: 15th June 2023
 * Where: Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection

We started with weekly meetings on Saturday mornings, which include the founder when he’s available, to coordinate our sprints. We also have standups, which team members have been free to contribute to when they have progress / next steps / or impediments to report. Other than these, we have largely been assigning ourselves tasks from the sprint JIRA, and working on them independently.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Our decision to make a prototype of what we want to make before starting on implementation helped save considerable time by providing guidance to our implementation.

* Communication between team members was good, with all team members regularly attending our meetings. Our weekly meetings on Saturday and standups were very helpful when trying to handle problems that arose in the course of the project and also to coordinate next steps and decisions.



#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* We each started work on our contributions to the project largely independently, while the project still had very little established structure, which made combining the resulting code cumbersome.
* The tasks we placed on JIRA were larger than we expected and were often a lot of work for a single team member to commit to. It would have helped our coordination and time management to have our tasks broken down into smaller chunks.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* During our next planning meeting (on Saturday) for the next sprint, we intend to go into more detail on our implementations to avoid having so many difficulties in combining our resulting code.
* During our next sprint, we intend to make more frequent pull requests to our dev branch to keep the code that we’re each working on more in sync, and to reduce the amount of complicated merge conflicts.
* For our next sprint, we will try to make our JIRA tasks for the sprint (our user stories) more fine-grained to allow for more dynamic assignments of responsibilities to team members and to encourage coordination


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Created the project
* User account creation (students and startups)
* User account login and logout (students and startups)
* User profile viewing (students and startups)
* Created the homepage

* Note: most of the above functionality can be viewed in either the main or dev branches of the project, except logout and profile viewing. Profile viewing can be viewed in the branch “C01-7-and-C01-21-View-User-Profile”. Its absence from dev is noted in the goals not met below.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* User profile editing (students and startups) (as of June 15th)
    * This was not met because it is in progress, but it is planned to be completed before the sprint ends
* Combining all functionality into a single branch (as of June 16th)
    * This task is partially completed, but has brought to light bugs that still need to be fixed, particularly regarding viewing detailed profile information for students and startups

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* We should merge our code more frequently to avoid conflicts, divergent development, and multiple implementations of the same functionality
* We should make our user stories more fine-grained in scope to keep the individual work items more manageable
