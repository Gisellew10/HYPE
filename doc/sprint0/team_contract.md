Team Agreement:

• All communication will be done over Slack, in the designated group channel.

• Any communication that requires a response should be replied to within 48 hours.

• Meetings will be every Saturday morning at 1:00pm upstairs in the Student Centre. Joining a meeting virtually is allowed if someone can't attend in person. If someone can't attend the meeting in person, they are expented to inform everyone they won't make it before the meeting starts.

• Minutes for meetings will be taken by Alex R and uploaded to Slack by the end of the same day.

• No particular preparation is required for the weekly meeting unless otherwise arranged.

• There will be a main branch and a dev branch. Pull requests will be made from individual's branches to dev. Dev should be in a working form after each merge. Merges should squish the merging branch's commit messages into a single commit message with full detail on the changes the branch made using the commit template in the sprint0 folder.

• As a scrum team, this team is self-organizing. Team members are expected to sign up to tasks by attaching their profile to the associated issue on Jira. Team members will describe their progress on their current issues and their next steps at each standup meeting. Standups will be conducted each morning by 11:00am on Slack starting after June 2nd. It is acceptible for a team member not to make progress on a given day, but team members are expected to finished any issues they sign up to by the end of the sprint.

• Our submissions will our main branch on dev. Alex R (or any other team member) will merge dev into main at the end of each sprint.

• Pull requests must include all commits in dev at the time they are made. They must be tested by the team member creating the pull request. They must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before being merged.

• In the event a team member is unreliable (ie. a team member drops out, a team member consistently
misses meetings, or a team member is academically dishonest) that team member's tasks will be transferred to other individuals on the team, and development will continue. However, in these cases we will also promptly seek help from the instructor, as it is important not to let such situations escalate.

We accept these guidelines and intend to fulfill them (sign below):
