#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

The product we are going to be building is called HYPE. It will start as a web application, that focuses on connecting students looking for internships and companies looking for interns. Primarily students with a passion for innovation who are looking to gain useful work experience by working alongside other innovators. This is where HYPE comes in, it connects students to companies by looking at what abilities students have/want, with what abilities the company wants/is willing to train. Students will sign up and create a profile that will show off what skills they have and what skills they are looking to acquire. They will also have a video resume attached to their profile that advertises themself and their accomplishments. On the flip side companies, mainly startups will set up a profile with job postings, and the app will act as the intermediator that will connect them with the relevant students. There is also an aspect that revolves around competition, where companies can host competitions that encourage students to team up and build innovative new products/ideas.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

* Student:
   * Name: Max
   * Background: Max is a student at UTSC working towards completing his computer science degree. Max has had a lot of curiosity about the world from a very young age. He has a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. Max is in his 3rd year and looking for new internship positions for the summer. He wants to work at a small company as he believes he has many good ideas and it would be difficult for him to express those ideas in a larger company. Max would describe himself as an innovator, entrepreneurial, and very tech-savvy. He is also afraid of cats.

* Recruiters:
   * Name: Ruby
   * Background: Ruby is a recruiting manager at XZY Tech looking to hire an intern from UTSC. XZY Tech specializes in developing innovative solutions for small companies' POS systems. As they are a small company themselves, they are looking for someone willing to help them expand the company by possibly working in multiple roles. Ruby has a lot of experience in the industry. She has helped recruit many people for plenty of start-ups that went on to be very successful. She has a deep passion for technology and problem-solving, and she is a people person. She also has 3 cats.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Users would choose this application as it primarily focuses on people and groups that consider themself/want to be innovators. From the company's perspective, this app is mainly for small start-ups, and what they get out of it is a way to find a unique group of people that are willing to work with them to help innovate and improve their start-ups. Compared to other sites/apps that help connect applicants to recruiters, it ties them down to find one person for one job, ex software developer. However, in a startup environment, you would benefit from instead having someone that can be a software developer mainly, but when needed they are willing to step up and help with other aspects of the company. As a student, you get to work at these places which makes it so that as an intern you get the most well-rounded experience, not only do you get experience in the field you want but you can explore other areas of the company to see/learn even more. Currently, these small startups are forced to use the same apps as the big guys, ie LinkedIn, zip recruiter etc. where the primary user base is people looking for one job.


#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 

A user story is considered done when the following has occurred:

   * The most up-to-date Dev branch is merged into the feature branch 
   * It is checked to see if the acceptance criteria are met
   * It is checked to see if the user story flow is working
   * It is smoke tested
   * Pull request to merge into the Dev branch
   * Once Merged it is deemed to be completed


### Highlights

Project idea:
* Initially, we had no idea what project we wanted to do. We liked Hype, Lime, and YourScope from the BRIDGE projects presentation. As a result, we decided that we should have at least one member of the team, go to the project presentations. We then later discussed what was presented, and which ideas we liked. With Lime, we like how it was presented and it was what felt like a full app already. However, we felt that we couldn't do/add much to the app. With YourScope we felt that they could do some more market research, and get some customer feedback as it didn't feel like they were sure of their idea. In the end, we landed on HPYE as something everyone would like to work on even though they seemed a little less on top of things, but it felt more like they wanted us to develop something with some input of our own.

Meeting frequency:
* We had a quick talk about how often we wanted to meet, and it was quickly concluded that we would meet once a week on Saturdays and 1 pm at the Student Centre. Other than that we would post our daily stand-ups in the Slack channel every day before 11 am. All other communication will be via Slack text messages unless we decide to add a meeting later on. This was decided as we wanted to keep a hand-off approach and limit the time we were meeting so that we could focus on actually doing the work rather than talking about it.

Backend:
* When we were discussing what stack we wanted to use we all were on the same page, except for what we wanted to write the backend in. So we came up with a short list of Grails, expressJS, Nest.Js, Flask, Spring and some others. in the end, we wanted to go with Spring because we want to work with a language we were familiar with and that had OOP that's why we decided to go with Java as the language. However, the setup was too complicated to get working on all our machines so we decided to go with expressJS as it has some notion of OOP and it is common in the industry.
