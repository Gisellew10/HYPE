# Git Hype

## Sprint 1

 * Start date: 3rd June 2023
 * End date: 16th June 2023

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

We haven’t explicitly assigned roles to each person. All team members have access to all communication platforms, both with each other and with the founder. We intend to select user stories from Jira to guide what tasks we perform, but anyone can take on any task.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

We meet in person every Saturday. In addition to team members, the founder is invited. In person is preferred (we meet on campus), but people can attend online. The purpose of the meeting this week is primarily to plan our upcoming sprint and go over our tech stack, but meetings can include any pressing issue the project faces.

We may also talk briefly after class on Tuesdays, but that meeting is not official and we aren’t requiring attendance. It’s just a place for team members to raise concerns if we don’t want to do so online.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

We have a Jira board with the user stories we aim to complete this sprint, which is our primary means of organizing the tasks we have to complete and who will handle each one. We also plan to communicate via our daily standups to keep informed of project progress and identify any impediments the team is facing.

Team members are responsible for assigning themselves to tasks on the Jira board, or volunteering to take on specific documents or tasks during team meetings. Any such agreement from a meeting will be included in the meeting minutes which get uploaded to Slack.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

Our sprint goal for this sprint is “Account Management”. Our user stories that we intend to complete this sprint include:

* logging in to and out of student and startup accounts
* creating, viewing, and updating accounts for students
* creating, viewing, and updating accounts for startups
* the creation of a home page from which someone can learn about Hype and can choose to create an account or log in

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

* the code itself, which will be uploaded to GitHub, and is important because it is the actual project
    * this is effectively an interactive mockup in addition to being the end goal, since it can be run locally to demonstrate the functionality of the project when done
* a wireframe of the intended layout of the project, created in figma, to guide our development efforts

* while it is not something we ourselves created, the founder has provided some example features created on Bubble that he would like us to use to help guide our development efforts as well
