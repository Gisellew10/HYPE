## Sprint 3 - Retrospective

 * When: July 22, 2023
 * Where: Student Center on Campus

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Communication between team members was good, with all team members regularly attending our meetings. We had weekly meetings on Saturday in addition to standups which were very helpful when trying to handle problems that arose in the course of the project and also to coordinate next steps and decisions. This allowed us to be able to handle more user stories which increased our team’s sprint velocity
* Our team started working on user stories earlier, which allowed us to be able to review and fix any issues that occurred before the end of the sprint
* Our change to push documentation deliverables to dev and then merge to main only at the end worked out well, and our final night before the end of the sprint was considerably less hectic this sprint because of this.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* Our process is largely based on individuals completing their manageable-sized tasks and combining them at the end. While including merging to dev as part of the definition of done has been helpful, there are still often cases where individual team members’ pieces need integration with each other, and that does not get accounted for.
* Our Tuesday meetings didn’t happen last sprint, and the coordination of the team didn’t suffer as a result. Our Saturday meetings and standups provided enough opportunity to coordinate the team. Still, this lead to some confusion among the team about if we were meeting on Tuesdays and where to be.


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* As next sprint will be the last sprint for this course, and given that there will be a final presentation after it’s completion, we will be changing our definition of done again to include not just merging our code to dev, but also integrating it with all other code on dev when it’s merged. This should cover situations where two people write pieces that need to interact in time for our final presentation.
* As we managed to coordinate effectively last sprint without our Tuesday meetings, we won’t be scheduling them this sprint. This should reduce the amount of time team members have to spend in meetings instead of writing code. It should also remove any confusion over whether these informal meetings were happening and when / where.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
* All of the stories were completed. We had a commitment of 44 story points worth of stories at the start of the sprint, and we managed to complete all of those stories, ending with a sprint velocity of 44. This is our highest sprint velocity yet. 
* The goals/tasks that were completed include:
    * Sending a New Message Between Students Using the Messages Page - Katy
    * Startup User Create Competition - Sanjay
    * Student User View Competitions - Jawad
    * Creating a Popup for Sending a Message when Clicking Message on one of the Cue Cards - Giselle
    * Ability to Delete Previously Sent Messages - Giselle
    * Ability to Delete A Chat - Katy
    * Adding the Create Group / Add Members Buttons to the Chats Page - Jawad
    * Search for Specific Student in Chats on Chats Page - Denise
    * Make Direct Messages Look Like Direct Messages instead of group chats - Denise
    * Functionality of Button to Connect to LinkedIn on Student Profile Cards And Ability to Enter LinkedIn on Profile Page - Pan
    * Make Student and Startup Avatars Editable (and include default avatars) - Pan
    * Editing Information Saved as Arrays on the Startup and Student Profile Pages - Alex

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* This sprint we completed all of the tasks that we planned.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Continuing to start earlier will allow us to better manage the project timeline and ensure we get tasks done on time. A more flexible process for submitting standups, starting earlier in the sprint than it did in the last one, should help facilitate this.
* Given that this will be our last sprint, and followed by a presentation, we will be keeping in mind the polish and presentability of our user stories this sprint.
